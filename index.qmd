```{r libraries, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggthemes)
library(knitr)
```

```{r car-plot}
car_plot <- read_rds("car-plot.rds")
car_plot
ggsave("car-plot.png", plot = car_plot)
```

This is a comment I am making to show how i made the image. First i did ggsave("car-plot = car_plot). This made an image of the car_plot graph. Then i did include_graphics("images/car-plot.png). Images is the folder that car-plot.png is in. 

```{r image}
include_graphics("images/car-plot.png")
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: car-plot
```
