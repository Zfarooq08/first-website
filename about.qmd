## About Me

My name is **Zayan Farooq** and I attend Walter Payton College Prep. I have an interest in Computer Science and I love to play soccer.

## About The Project

My project, Can Sports be Directly Related to Knee Injuries, shows many different types of sports and how over time may correlate to knee injuries.

### Goals

-   Find out if sports are directly related to knee injuries

-   Create a advanced bar graph showing different sports and the amount of knee injuries over time

    -   A possible challenge could be figuring out how to format my plot
